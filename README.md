# Aseprite Colour Stepper Shortcuts

## What is it ?
A quick set of scripts that you can map to "keyboard shortcuts" so you can easily add shades to your sprites 

## How to use it ?
1. Download the zip
1. Create a folder for example aseprite_colour_steppers
1. Unzip  and add the new folder (aseprite_colour_steppers) to your Aseprite script's folder, usually in "C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Aseprite\scripts"
1. Go to File>Scripts>Rescan Scripts Folder
1. Go to File>Scripts>aseprite_colour_steppers>hsl_config_dialog (optional if you want to tweak the steps, default values are 10%, you may need to allow write access for the config file), set your steps from 0 to 100
1. Go to Edit>Keyboard Shortcuts
    - search for mappable_colour_scripts (or by the script's name)
    - assign a key to each step option (ex. map decrease_hue to SHIFT+1)...
1. Use your newly assigned keyboard shortcuts in Aseprite
